The stages of the process:
1. In fact, the employee fills out the advance request form by entering the fields:

➔ Work number

➔ Date in which he wishes to have the sum

➔ The amount

➔ The reason he wants to have it.

2. Then the head of the HR department will check the completeness of the request in terms of information entered.

3. If it is incomplete, he will ask the employee to review his request.

4. Otherwise he will transfer it to the head of the financial department DAF who will check if the amount is valid or not, that is to say that the advance does not exceed
the 50% of the salary.

5. If the amount is valid (does not exceed 50%) it will send the result to the employee.

6. Otherwise he will ask him to revise his request.
